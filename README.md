## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Train)
- RMSE (Test)
- MAE (Test)

## Key Observations
- Linear Regression underfits due to high bias.
- Decision Tree overfits due to high variance.
- Ridge Regression provides better generalization.

## Dataset
